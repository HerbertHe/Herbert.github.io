# Blog

The blog is developed with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev), and the theme is based on [clark-cui/vitepress-blog-zaun](https://github.com/clark-cui/vitepress-blog-zaun).

I've redeveloped the theme to support some personal features, such as:

- [x] Use Giscus instead of gitalk
- [x] Support `$draft` and `$pin` tags
